# Zenod-Racing-Game
Did you know you could play a simple 2D racing game in your linux terminal? Yeah you heard me right!!! Zenod Racing Game makes this possible... This was made possible after an inspiration of my previous failure in creating the Jimbo Crime City and Pigroma Hunt.... Every thing is possible in programming.
